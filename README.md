## SetState
* Always make use of setState and never modify the state directly.
* Code has to be executed after the state has been updated? Place that code in the call back function which is the second argument to the setState method.
* When you have to update state based on the previous state value, pass in a function as an argument instead of the regular object.

## Destructuring props and state

## Binding Event Handlers
* Binding Event Handler using Arrow Function
* Binding Event Handler in Render Method: We can bind the handler when it is called in the render method using **bind() method. 
* Binding Event Handler in the Constructor: We are going to bind the event handler inside the constructor. This is also the approach that is mentioned in ReactJS documentation. This has performance benefits as the events arenâ€™t binding every time the method is called, as opposed to the previous two approaches. Just add the following line in the constructor for this approach.
* Binding Event Handler using Arrow Function as a Class Property: This is probably the best way to bind the events and still pass in parameters to the event handlers easily.
